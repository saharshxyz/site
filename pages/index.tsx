        Oh, you want to know more about me? Instead of reading some random text
        blob about me, shoot me an email saying "hi" to{' '}

          sup [at] sahar.sh{' '}
        </a>{' '}
        and I'll send you my number so we can actually get to know each other.
        Don't be shy, I don't bite and I'll reply quickly â€” I promise :)
